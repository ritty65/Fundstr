The "Nostr Patreon-like Platform" is an application that allows creators to set up and offer support tiers to their audience using the decentralized Nostr protocol. Supporters can discover these creators and pledge their support directly. All tier and pledge information is published as Nostr events, making the system open and resistant to censorship, with users managing their identities via Nostr keys.

## Features

- Generate and manage Nostr key pairs
